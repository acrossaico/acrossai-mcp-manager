/**
 * Category_Registrar for the Toolset dispatchers.
 *
 * Every Toolset declares this category, and it deliberately holds nothing
 * else. Sharing a category with the abilities a Toolset dispatches to would
 * mean the operator's setting for that category applied to the Toolset
 * itself — which is what forced four separate requirements out of the earlier
 * category-based design. See DEC-ABILITY-GROUP-IDENTIFIER-LOAD-BEARING.
 *
 * Follows the house pattern used by the other 25 folders rather than folding
 * the registration into the abstract class, because
 * `Test_Category_Registrar_Wiring` guards that convention in both directions —
 * and a category registrar that exists but is never wired makes every ability
 * claiming it silently cease to exist (BUG-UNWIRED-CATEGORY-REGISTRAR).
