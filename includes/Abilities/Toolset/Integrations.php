/**
 * The Integrations Toolset — a directory of plugin capability, and a way to run it.
 *
 * Every other Toolset covers one area of WordPress. This one covers every OTHER
 * Toolset that is not part of the server type's default set: the per-plugin
 * dispatchers that come and go as plugins are installed.
 *
 * It exists because of a limitation on the other side of the wire. An MCP client
 * caches `tools/list` when it connects and there is no way to tell it the list
 * changed — the adapter advertises `tools.listChanged: false` and its
 * server-to-client channel is unimplemented. Measured, with controls: a client
 * given both corrections ignored the notification anyway.
 *
 * So a client that connected before WooCommerce was installed will never see
 * `toolset/woocommerce`, however long it stays connected. This Toolset is always
 * in the default set, so that client always has it — and through it, everything
 * it cannot see. It **runs** abilities as well as listing them; a directory that
 * only describes leaves the caller exactly where it started.
 *
 * The two halves are complementary by construction. `Base_Toolset_Ability`'s
 * `is_server_type_default()` decides what leaves the menu, and the same answer
 * decides what appears here, via `acrossai_toolset_integration_groups`. A new
 * per-plugin Toolset joins both by declaring neither.

	 * Once the caller narrows — `plugin` for one of them, or `search` across all
